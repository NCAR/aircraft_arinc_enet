Readme File - Linux /Source folder

This folder contains the Alta Layer 1 API source files, along with a makefile that
builds these files into a shared object file.

Additionally, for 64-bit Linux platforms, there is a makefile (makefile.32bit) to create a 32-bit shared object file for using on the 64-bit platform. 

This shared object file, along with the Layer 0 shared object file, is used in the
/Test folder to build and run Alta example programs.

All of the Global, 1553, and A429 example programs can be found in the /Examples
folder.

REFER TO THE ALTA API USERS MANUAL, APPENDIX B (LINUX) FOR DETAILS.
